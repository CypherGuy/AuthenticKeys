# AuthenticKeys
A GUI that allows you to make authentic keys using upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols(WIP!).

A 'key' is split into sections called parts and seperators, see below for an example.

5de42-dnnvt-32rjÂ£ 

'5de42' is a section, 
'-' is your seperator
The entire thing is the key.

This project is not fully finished yet so there may still be some errors.
